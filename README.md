<h1>Onit</h1>

Not your average "to-do" application. With Onit a user can not only create a to do list but once logged in, the app will allow users to store the lists for later. Onit allows users to create sub-tasks for each task in a list, as well as cross all task and subtasks off as you complete them. There is a progress bar that is interactive in each item on a list so the user has a visual representation of their progress. There is also a seperate area where you can view all items marked important from all lists together. We have also included an everchanging inspirational quote for motivation and a mental health check in and tracker because mental health is just as important as profuctivity!
